# xlFiveChess

It is first created in 2006, in the Visual C++ course at Zhejiang University.
It only contains basic judgement according to the simplest File chess rule.
You can chess by your left hand and your right hand.

After Google Alpha-Go, I use it to learn AI programming.
The latest branch is called "alpha-five". :)
